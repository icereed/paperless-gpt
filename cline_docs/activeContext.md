# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing standalone binary distribution support using GoReleaser

## Recent Changes
1. Created GoReleaser configuration (.goreleaser.yaml)
   - Configured for Linux/amd64 builds with CGO support
   - Set up musl tag for SQLite compatibility
   - Configured Docker image publishing
   - Added version and build information

2. Added GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml)
   - Set up automated releases on tags
   - Configured proper dependency installation
   - Added artifact uploading

3. Updated README.md with standalone binary installation instructions
   - Added system dependency requirements
   - Included environment configuration guide
   - Added verification steps

4. Created release process documentation
   - Added release PR template
   - Included comprehensive checklist
   - Documented build requirements

5. Set up local testing infrastructure
   - Created Dockerfile.goreleaser for isolated testing
   - Added test-goreleaser.sh helper script

## Current State
- GoReleaser configuration completed and ready for testing
- Documentation updated with binary installation instructions
- Docker-based testing environment prepared
- Release process documentation in place

## Active Questions/Issues
1. Docker daemon appears to be stuck and requires machine restart
2. Need to complete local GoReleaser testing after restart

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. After machine restart:
   - Test GoReleaser configuration using Dockerfile.goreleaser
   - Run test builds to verify binary creation
   - Verify binary works with required dependencies
   - Test the complete release process in snapshot mode

2. Post-testing tasks:
   - Verify binary functionality on a clean system
   - Test environment variable configuration
   - Confirm CGO dependencies are properly handled
   - Ensure MuPDF integration works correctly

### Future Considerations
1. Keep documentation updated with:
   - New feature implementations
   - Architecture changes
   - Configuration updates
   - Bug fixes and improvements

2. Documentation maintenance:
   - Regular reviews for accuracy
   - Updates for new developments
   - Removal of obsolete information
   - Addition of new patterns/technologies

## Active Questions/Issues
None currently - initial setup phase

## Recent Decisions
1. Created comprehensive documentation structure
2. Organized information into logical sections
3. Prioritized key system components
4. Established documentation patterns
