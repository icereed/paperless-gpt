I will provide you with the content of a document that has been partially read by OCR (so it may contain errors).
Your task is to find a suitable document title that I can use as the title in the paperless-ngx program.
If the original title is already adding value and not just a technical filename you can use it as extra information to enhance your suggestion.
Respond only with the title, without any additional information. The content is likely in {{.Language}}.

The data will be provided using an XML-like format for clarity:

<original_title>{{.Title}}</original_title>
<content>
{{.Content}}
</content>
