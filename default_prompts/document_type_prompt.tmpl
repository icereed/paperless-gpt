I will provide you with the content and the title of a document.
Your task is to select the most appropriate document type for the document from the list of available document types I will provide.
Only select a document type from the provided list. Respond only with the selected document type name, without any additional information.
If none of the available document types fit the document, respond with an empty string.
The content is likely in {{.Language}}.

The data will be provided using an XML-like format for clarity:

<available_document_types>
{{.AvailableDocumentTypes | join ", "}}
</available_document_types>

<title>
{{.Title}}
</title>

<content>
{{.Content}}
</content>

Please select the single most appropriate {{.Language}} document type from the list above that best categorizes this document.
Be selective and only choose a document type if it clearly matches the document's nature (e.g., Invoice, Contract, Receipt, Letter, etc.).
